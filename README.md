I use this repo instead of a blog.  
Because it is for studying English, I will write it without any discipline.  
Therefore, if you find the wrong English expression or have a suggestion for an article you would like me to write, please let me know in an issue or pull request.  
File names written in camel case are in diary format, and other file names are codes and memos.
